</p>

AmbiSense is an innovative smart lighting solution that uses radar sensing technology to create responsive ambient lighting experiences. The system detects movement and distance using an LD2410 radar sensor and dynamically controls NeoPixel LED strips in real-time, creating an interactive lighting environment.

The core of AmbiSense is built around an ESP32 microcontroller that interfaces with an LD2410 radar module and NeoPixel LED strips. The system creates a moving light pattern that responds to a person's proximity, with the illuminated section of the LED strip changing based on detected distance.

We also developed a [Custom Home Assistant Integration](https://github.com/Techposts/ambisense-homeassistant) allowing you to integrate and control the AmbiSense from the Home Assistant and also run powerful automations.
