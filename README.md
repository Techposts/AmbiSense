  <h3>Smart Lighting with Radar Motion Detection</h3>
  <p>Created by <a href="https://github.com/Techposts">Ravi Singh</a> (TechPosts Media)</p>
</div>

## üåü Overview

AmbiSense is an innovative smart lighting solution that uses radar sensing technology to create responsive ambient lighting experiences. The system detects movement and distance using an LD2410 radar sensor and dynamically controls NeoPixel LED strips in real-time, creating an interactive lighting environment.

Unlike traditional motion sensors, AmbiSense's radar technology:
- Works through walls and surfaces
- Detects both presence and precise distance
- Doesn't require line-of-sight
- Functions perfectly in darkness
- Has no privacy concerns (unlike camera-based solutions)

## üß∞ Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board (recommended: ESP32-C3 SuperMini)
- LD2410 radar sensor module
- WS2812B (NeoPixel) compatible LED strip
- 5V power supply (adequate for your LED strip length)
- Connecting wires

## üì° Circuit Connections

### ESP32-C3 SuperMini to LD2410 Radar
- Connect ESP32 GPIO3 (RX) to LD2410 TX
- Connect ESP32 GPIO4 (TX) to LD2410 RX
- Connect ESP32 5V to LD2410 VCC
- Connect ESP32 GND to LD2410 GND

### ESP32-C3 SuperMini to WS2812B LED Strip
- Connect ESP32 GPIO5 to WS2812B DIN (Data In)
- Connect ESP32 5V to WS2812B VCC
- Connect ESP32 GND to WS2812B GND

### Power Supply

</div>

**Note**: For longer LED strips, it's recommended to connect the 5V power supply directly to the WS2812B VCC to avoid overloading the ESP32's voltage regulator. Always ensure adequate current capacity for your LED strip length.

## ‚ö° Power Requirements

- Input: 5V DC via power jack
- Current: Depends on the number of LEDs (roughly calculate ~60mA per LED at full brightness)
- For strips longer than 30 LEDs, use a power supply rated for at least 2A or more. I used a 5V 2A for demo, works fine for up to 50 LEDs

## üîß Software Setup

   - LD2410 Library
4. Select the appropriate board (ESP32-C3)
5. Upload the code to your ESP32
6. Power on the device
7. Connect to the WiFi network "AmbiSense" (password: 12345678)
8. Navigate to http://192.168.4.1 in your browser

</div>
9. Use the web interface to configure:
   - Number of LEDs
   - Minimum/maximum detection distance
   - LED color
   - Brightness
   - Moving light span (Number of LEDs that will run along)
   - Light mode
   - Directional light trails
   - Background lighting mode
   - Center shift adjustment
   - WiFi network settings

### Option 2: Flashing Pre-compiled Binaries

You can flash the pre-compiled binaries directly to your ESP32-C3 using one of the following methods:

#### Using ESP Flash Download Tool (Recommended for beginners)

1. Download ESP Flash Download Tool:
   - Download from the official Espressif website: [ESP Flash Download Tool](https://dl.espressif.com/public/flash_download_tool.zip)
   - Flash tool User guide: [Flash Download Tools (ESP8266 & ESP32) Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-test-tools/en/latest/esp32/production_stage/tools/flash_download_tool.html)
2. Extract and run the tool
3. Select "ESP32-C3 RISC-V" from the chip type dropdown
4. Configure the tool as follows:
   - Set SPI SPEED to "80MHz"
   - Set SPI MODE to "DIO"
   - Set FLASH SIZE to "4MB" (or match your ESP32-C3's flash size)
5. Download and add the binary files with these specific addresses:
   - Add `AmbiSense-ESP32C3-bootloader.bin` at address 0x0
   - Add `AmbiSense-ESP32C3-partitions.bin` at address 0x8000
   - Add `AmbiSense-ESP32C3.bin` at address 0x10000
6. Ensure all three checkboxes next to the file paths are checked
7. Select the appropriate COM port where your ESP32-C3 is connected
8. Set the baud rate to 921600 for faster flashing
9. Click the "START" button to begin flashing
10. Wait for the tool to display "FINISH" when the flashing is complete
11. Press the reset button on your ESP32-C3 board

*(Example of ESP Flash Download Tool configuration - your file paths will be different)*

#### Using esptool.py (Alternative method)

1. Install esptool using pip (requires Python):
   ```
   pip install esptool
   ```
2. Open Command Prompt (cmd) and navigate to your binary files:
   ```
   cd C:\path\to\your\binaries
   ```
3. Flash your ESP32-C3 with this command (replace COM3 with your actual port):
   ```
   esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port COM3 --baud 921600 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 4MB 0x0 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-bootloader.bin 0x8000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-partitions.bin 0x10000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3.bin
   ```

##### Troubleshooting:
- If you have connection issues, try erasing the flash first:
  ```
  esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port COM3 erase_flash
  ```
- If you still have issues, try a lower baud rate:
  ```
  esptool.py --chip esp32c3 --port COM3 --baud 115200 write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 4MB 0x0 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-bootloader.bin 0x8000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-partitions.bin 0x10000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3.bin
  ```
- For detailed logs, add the -v flag:
  ```
  esptool.py -v --chip esp32c3 --port COM3 --baud 921600 write_flash -z --flash_mode dio --flash_freq 80m --flash_size 4MB 0x0 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-bootloader.bin 0x8000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3-partitions.bin 0x10000 AmbiSense-ESP32C3.bin
  ```

### After Flashing

1. Power on the device
2. Connect to the WiFi network "AmbiSense" (password: 12345678)
3. Navigate to http://192.168.4.1 in your browser
